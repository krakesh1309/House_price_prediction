# House Price Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict house prices using machine learning techniques. The dataset used for training and evaluation contains various features such as the size of the house, number of bedrooms, location, etc. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately predict the price of a house given its features.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from kaggle.com. It consists of many samples and features. Some of the key features include:
- Size of the house (in square feet)
- Number of bedrooms
- Number of bathrooms
- Size of House
- Price of house
- Lots size
- zip code
- ...

## Dependencies
